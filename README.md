# Data Structures and Algorithms Visualization
This website was created as a quick refresher and revision system for my NYU Algorithms course. As I progress I will be adding more and more features/structures with higher levels of functionality to the wesbite
This isn't hosted on anything as of now, but will be uploaded up using Vercel relatively soon

Below are a few operations that have been incorporated into the website. The static screenshot does not capture the animations, but this should be enough to show off some basic features
## Array Operations

## Running
As of now you can only clone it to run it on node locally
```
node index.js
```
